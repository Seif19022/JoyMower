# RoboWatch
This repository houses the complete source code for the RoboWatch app, which empowers users to remotely control and monitor robotic devices for surveillance purposes.

## Overview
RoboWatch App is an android mobile application designed to provide remote control and surveillance capabilities for a robot equipped with a camera. The key goals of the application are to enable real-time video streaming, manual robot control, alerts and notifications based on data received from the robot, and robust monitoring system to closely observe and analyse the robot's performance, enabling us to make informed decisions and enhance its overall effectiveness.

## Features
- **Robust Monitoring System:** A comprehensive monitoring system to track the robot's status, and sensor data. The home monitoring system enables users to monitor and alter the robot's status, including its power state (ON/OFF) and movement type (Autonomous or Manual).
- **Manual Control:** Control the robot's movements using an intuitive joystick interface, and its pan-tilt camera using on-screen buttons.
- **Live Video Stream:** View real-time video feed from the robot's camera.
- **Scheduled Mowing:** Schedule automated mowing for the robot to perform designated tasks at specific times.
- **Historical Data and Analytics:** Access and analyze historical surveillance data and analytics.
- **Notifications and Alerts:** Receive notifications and alerts based on predefined criteria and sensor data. Stay informed about important events and activities detected by the robot.
- **Authentication and Sign-Up:** Secure user authentication system that ensures only authorized users can access the app's functionalities. New users can create their accounts securely through a sign-up feature.
